# Agony Warlock Calculator
Agony Warlock is a Hearthstone archetype that kills its opponent by burning their deck with [Altar of Fire](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Altar_of_Fire) and then shuffling [Agonies](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Agony) into their deck with [Curse of Agony](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_Agony). Each Agony does one more damage than the previous one. [This](https://aar015.github.io/agony-calc) calculator will determine the chance of lethal of an agony combo.

## How to Use
Enter your opponent's health, the number of real cards in their deck, and the number of agonies you shuffled into their deck into the calculator. Check the box if they have [The Immovable Object](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/The_Immovable_Object) equipped. Press the calculate button to calculate your chance of lethal next turn.
